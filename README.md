# Termnotion - Notion from the terminal

Hi, I'm Joshua. A student at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez
I'm a second year Software Eng. Student looking to do projects for fun.

Notion is part of my daily driver to organize my life, studying habits 
and coding habits. 

This repo is made to get quick notion data from notion. 
Any suggestion or feature you might want. Please set an issue for it.
